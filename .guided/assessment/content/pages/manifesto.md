## Content Blocks Outline

### 1. Introduction Section
- **Heading:** "Career Manifesto"
- **Content:**
  - Why a manifesto? (values drive framework design)
  - Career development as fundamental to professional fulfillment
  - Commitment to transparency, fairness, and growth
  - Eight principles that guide everything

### 2. Eight Principles (Numbered Icon Cards)

**Principle 1: Transparency**
- **Statement:** "Career expectations should be clear, documented, and accessible to everyone."
- **Why It Matters:**
  - Opaque criteria enable bias and favoritism
  - Transparency builds trust and psychological safety
  - Clear expectations empower self-advocacy
- **In Practice:**
  - Published level definitions
  - Documented promotion criteria
  - Open calibration rationales (where appropriate)

**Principle 2: Fair Recognition**
- **Statement:** "Advancement should be based on impact and competency, not politics or tenure."
- **Why It Matters:**
  - Meritocracy requires objective criteria
  - Tenure alone doesn't indicate readiness for next level
  - Political skills shouldn't outweigh contribution
- **In Practice:**
  - Evidence-based promotion decisions
  - Calibration to reduce bias
  - Impact×Autonomy framework over "years of experience"

**Principle 3: Equality of Opportunity**
- **Statement:** "Multiple paths to seniority must exist, honoring different strengths and aspirations."
- **Why It Matters:**
  - Not everyone wants to manage
  - Technical expertise deserves equal recognition
  - Diversity of thought requires diversity of paths
- **In Practice:**
  - IC and Manager tracks with equal seniority potential
  - Technical Lead track (W-Model)
  - Shapes framework (I, T, Pi) honoring different skill profiles

**Principle 4: Growth Mindset**
- **Statement:** "Proficiency is developed, not innate. Everyone can grow with support and intentionality."
- **Why It Matters:**
  - Fixed mindset limits potential
  - Development planning enables growth
  - Feedback and coaching accelerate learning
- **In Practice:**
  - Proficiency scales (1-5) show growth trajectory
  - Development plans focus on pillar growth
  - Career conversations prioritize learning

**Principle 5: Evidence-Based**
- **Statement:** "Decisions should be grounded in demonstrated impact, not gut feeling or subjective opinion."
- **Why It Matters:**
  - Reduces bias (conscious and unconscious)
  - Increases fairness and consistency
  - Enables objective discussions
- **In Practice:**
  - Promotion packets with impact examples
  - Calibration discussions reference evidence
  - Level criteria include observable behaviors

**Principle 6: Continuous Feedback**
- **Statement:** "Career development requires ongoing dialogue, not annual performance reviews alone."
- **Why It Matters:**
  - Surprises in annual reviews indicate broken feedback loops
  - Regular conversations enable course correction
  - Feedback accelerates growth
- **In Practice:**
  - Quarterly career conversations (recommended)
  - Real-time feedback on projects
  - Open-door culture for career questions

**Principle 7: Flexibility & Experimentation**
- **Statement:** "Career paths should support exploration, role changes, and even reversals without penalty."
- **Why It Matters:**
  - Career interests evolve over time
  - Trial management experiences (W-Model) reduce risk
  - Rigid paths create regret and turnover
- **In Practice:**
  - IC ↔ Manager transitions supported
  - Lateral moves encouraged for learning
  - "Demotion" reframed as "role change" without stigma

**Principle 8: Open & Evolving**
- **Statement:** "Career frameworks should be open-source, collaborative, and continuously improved based on feedback."
- **Why It Matters:**
  - No single organization has all the answers
  - Community contributions improve the framework
  - Transparency in framework design builds trust
- **In Practice:**
  - MIT license (free to use and adapt)
  - GitHub repository for contributions
  - Version control and changelog
  - Community discussions for improvements

### 3. Living the Manifesto Section
- **Heading:** "Putting Principles into Practice"
- **Content:**
  - These aren't aspirations; they're design requirements
  - Every framework component reflects these principles:
    - Transparency → Published leveling criteria
    - Fair Recognition → Impact×Autonomy over tenure
    - Equality → Multiple tracks (Y/W/Network models)
    - Growth Mindset → Proficiency pillars with development paths
    - Evidence-Based → Calibration processes
    - Continuous Feedback → Career conversation guides
    - Flexibility → Topology transitions (especially W-Model)
    - Open & Evolving → GitHub community engagement
  - Organizations adopting the framework commit to these principles

### 4. Call to Action Section
- **Heading:** "Join the Movement"
- **Content:**
  - If these principles resonate, implement the framework
  - Share feedback and contribute improvements
  - Build transparent career systems in your organization
  - CTA: "Explore the Framework" → /framework
  - CTA: "Contribute on GitHub" → /contributing

## Page Role in Site Architecture

**Position:** Foundational philosophy page

## Notes

- **Differentiation:** Many frameworks lack explicit values; manifesto is unique positioning
- **Cultural Fit Screener:** Organizations uncomfortable with Transparency or Flexibility may not be good fits
- **Advocacy Tool:** ICs and change agents can use manifesto to build internal case
- **Inspiration + Practicality:** Each principle includes "In Practice" examples (not just ideals)
- **Open Source Alignment:** Principle 8 (Open & Evolving) reflects GitHub-centric approach
- **North Star:** Principles guide trade-offs during implementation (e.g., "Does this preserve transparency?")
- **Emotional Resonance:** Appeals to desire for fairness and growth (beyond just process efficiency)
- **Risk Factor:** Organizations may love principles but struggle with cultural change required to live them
