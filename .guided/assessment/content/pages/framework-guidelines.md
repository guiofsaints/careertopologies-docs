# Guidelines Page Documentation

## Page Identity

**Route:** `/framework/guidelines`  
**Page Title:** Guidelines  
**Component:** GuidelinesPage.tsx  
**Category:** Framework  
**Primary Purpose:** Provide tactical implementation guidance including roles, workflows, timeline, and calibration processes for operationalizing the Career Topologies framework

---

## Page Purpose Statement

The Guidelines page is the most tactical resource in the framework section, offering:
1. Framework Flow Diagram showing the application process
2. Roles & Responsibilities Matrix defining who does what
3. Implementation Timeline (Gantt chart) with realistic 52+ week schedule
4. Step-by-step processes for calibration, promotion cycles, and career conversations

This page transforms framework concepts into operational procedures for HR teams and managers.

### 4. Implementation Timeline Section
- **Heading:** "Implementation Timeline"
- **Component:** Gantt chart showing 8 phases over 52+ weeks
- **Phases:**
  1. **Assessment (Weeks 1-4):** Current state analysis, stakeholder interviews
  2. **Design (Weeks 5-12):** Topology selection, level definition, pillar mapping
  3. **Pilot Preparation (Weeks 13-16):** Select pilot team, train managers

  6. **Organization Training (Weeks 29-36):** Train all managers and ICs
  7. **Full Rollout (Weeks 37-48):** Apply framework org-wide
  8. **Stabilization (Weeks 49-52+):** First calibration cycle, ongoing operations

### 5. Calibration Process Section
- **Heading:** "Running Calibration Sessions"
- **Purpose:** Ensure consistency in level assessments across teams
- **Process:**
  1. **Pre-Calibration:** Managers prepare IC assessments with evidence
  2. **Calibration Meeting:** Cross-functional review of assessments (2-4 hours)
  3. **Discussion:** Challenge and align on borderline cases
  4. **Consensus:** Agree on final level assessments
  5. **Documentation:** Record decisions and rationale
  6. **Communication:** Managers share outcomes with ICs
- **Frequency:** Semi-annually or annually
- **Participants:** Managers, HR/People team, department heads (optional: skip-level leaders)

### 6. Promotion Cycle Process Section
- **Heading:** "Promotion Cycle Workflow"
- **Process:**
  1. **Nomination (Month 1):** Managers nominate ICs ready for promotion
  2. **Evidence Collection (Month 1-2):** Gather examples demonstrating next-level impact
  3. **Calibration (Month 2):** Review nominees in calibration session
  4. **Decision (Month 2):** Approve promotions based on framework criteria
  5. **Communication (Month 3):** Announce promotions, explain outcomes to non-promoted
  6. **Effective Date (Month 3):** Update titles, responsibilities, compensation
- **Frequency:** Annually or bi-annually
- **Timeline:** 3-month cycle recommended

### 7. Career Conversation Guide Section
- **Heading:** "Conducting Career Conversations"
- **Frequency:** Quarterly or as needed
- **Agenda Template:**
  1. Review current level and expectations (use Leveling page)
  2. Assess proficiency across six pillars (use Progression page)
  3. Identify 1-2 focus areas for development
  4. Discuss career aspirations (IC track, management, etc.)
  5. Create action plan with specific goals
  6. Schedule follow-up check-ins
- **Manager Prep:**
  - Review IC's recent work and impact
  - Gather 360 feedback (optional)
  - Prepare specific examples (positive and growth areas)
- **IC Prep:**
  - Self-assess against current level criteria
  - Bring examples of impact
  - Prepare questions about career paths

### 8. Common Pitfalls & Solutions Section
- **Heading:** "Avoiding Common Pitfalls"
- **Pitfall 1:** "Levels don't match our current titles"
  - **Solution:** Map framework levels to org-specific titles (e.g., "Staff Engineer" = Level 6)
- **Pitfall 2:** "Managers resist transparency"
  - **Solution:** Train on equity benefits, involve managers in design phase
- **Pitfall 3:** "Calibration sessions become political"
  - **Solution:** Focus on evidence, document criteria, facilitate with HR
- **Pitfall 4:** "ICs don't understand expectations"
  - **Solution:** Publish level definitions, provide examples, hold office hours
- **Pitfall 5:** "Compensation misalignment"
  - **Solution:** Map levels to salary bands early, get exec buy-in

## Forms and Interactive Elements

**None** - Guidelines page is process documentation with visual references (diagrams, matrix, timeline). No data input or interactive tools.

---

## Visual Components

### 1. Framework Flow Diagram
- **Type:** Process flowchart
- **Nodes:** 7 steps in framework application
- **Arrows:** Sequential flow with feedback loops
- **Purpose:** Visualize the complete workflow from setup to ongoing operations
- **Insight:** Framework is not "set and forget" - requires continuous calibration

### 2. Roles & Responsibilities Matrix
- **Type:** Table with rows (roles) and columns (responsibility areas)
- **Cells:** Specific duties and decision authorities
- **Purpose:** Clarify ownership and prevent confusion during implementation
- **Visual Treatment:** Color-coded or icon-marked for primary vs. supporting roles

### 3. Implementation Timeline (Gantt Chart)
- **Type:** Gantt chart showing 8 phases over time
- **Timeline:** Week 0 → Week 52+ (13 months)
- **Bars:** Duration and dependencies of each phase
- **Milestones:** Key decision points (pilot go/no-go, full rollout approval)
- **Purpose:** Set realistic expectations for implementation duration
- **Insight:** Full implementation takes a year - not a quick fix

## SEO and Metadata (Inferred)

**Target Keywords:** career framework implementation, calibration process, promotion cycle workflow, career conversation guide, framework roles and responsibilities  
**Meta Description (likely):** "Tactical implementation guide for Career Topologies framework. Includes roles matrix, 52-week timeline, calibration process, and promotion cycle workflow."  
**Primary Audience:** HR teams, implementation leads, managers operationalizing the framework  

---

## Mobile Considerations

- Gantt chart may require horizontal scroll on mobile
- Roles matrix should be responsive (possibly stacked cards on mobile)
- Long process descriptions should be scannable with clear headings
- Printable format for managers to use offline

---

## Page Role in Site Architecture

**Position:** Core tactical resource within Framework section  
**Function:** Operational procedures and implementation playbook  
**User Type:** Practitioners executing framework (HR, managers)  
**Relation to Other Pages:**  
- Child of /framework
- Most tactical page in framework section (vs. Leveling/Progression which are reference tools)
- Complements other framework pages by showing "how to do it"

---

## Notes

- **Most Procedural Page:** Provides step-by-step processes (vs. conceptual explanations)
- **Critical for Success:** Implementation often fails without clear processes and ownership
- **Realistic Timeline:** 52+ weeks acknowledges complexity (avoids overpromising)
- **Change Management Focus:** Common pitfalls section addresses human/organizational challenges
- **Tool Integration Opportunity:** Workflows could be supported by software tools (assessment platforms, promotion tracking, etc.)
- **Customization Expected:** Organizations will adapt these processes to their culture and scale
- **Living Document:** Processes may evolve based on feedback and experience
- **Manager Enablement:** Career conversation guide reduces manager anxiety about "doing it right"
