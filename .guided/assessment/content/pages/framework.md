# Framework Page Documentation

## Page Identity

**Route:** `/framework`  
**Page Title:** Career Topologies Framework  
**Component:** FrameworkPage.tsx  
**Category:** Framework  
**Primary Purpose:** Explain the overall framework structure, core elements, governance model, and implementation lifecycle

---

## Page Purpose Statement

The Framework page provides a structured overview of how the Career Topologies framework operates in practice, covering:
1. The four core structural elements that compose the framework
2. Governance mechanisms for maintaining consistency
3. The four-phase implementation lifecycle (Assessment, Design, Pilot, Rollout)
4. Critical considerations for successful adoption

This page bridges high-level philosophy (Manifesto, About) with tactical implementation (Guidelines).

## Forms and Interactive Elements

**None** - Framework page is informational with navigation links. No data input forms or interactive tools on this page.

---

## Visual Components

**None directly on this page** - While the page describes the framework structure and lifecycle, visual components (diagrams, flowcharts, timelines) are located on the Guidelines page (/framework/guidelines), which provides tactical implementation details.

**Implied Visual (Not on Page):**
- Implementation Timeline (Gantt chart) - located on Guidelines page
- Framework Architecture Diagram - could be added to visualize how components connect

## Content Characteristics

**Tone:** Professional, structured, authoritative  
**Length:** Medium-Long (~1500-2000 words estimated)  
**Complexity:** Medium - assumes understanding of career frameworks, provides structured detail  
**Call-to-Action Intensity:** Medium - guides toward Guidelines for implementation details  
**Visual Density:** Low - text-focused with clear section headings (visuals on Guidelines page)  

---

## SEO and Metadata (Inferred)

**Target Keywords:** career framework implementation, career topologies structure, career framework governance, career progression framework, implementing career levels  
**Meta Description (likely):** "The Career Topologies Framework provides a modular structure with four core elements: topologies, levels, progression pillars, and shapes. Learn the implementation lifecycle and governance model."  
**Primary Audience:** HR teams and leaders evaluating or implementing career frameworks  

---

## Mobile Considerations

- Clear section headings for easy scrolling
- Card-based layout for four core elements
- Phase-based breakdown for implementation lifecycle (expandable accordions could improve UX)
- Prominent CTAs at bottom for next steps

---

## Page Role in Site Architecture

**Position:** Secondary hub for framework implementation  
**Function:** Bridge between philosophy (About, Manifesto) and tactics (Guidelines, Leveling, Progression)  
**User Type:** Decision-makers and implementers needing structured overview  
**Relation to Other Pages:**  
- More detailed than Home or About
- Less tactical than Guidelines
- Parent to Leveling, Progression, Guidelines sub-pages

---

## Notes

- **Implementation Focus:** This page emphasizes "how to adopt" more than "what it is"
- **Lifecycle Clarity:** Four-phase model provides realistic timeline expectations (52+ weeks)
- **Governance Emphasis:** Highlights ongoing effort required (not just initial setup)
- **Modular Messaging:** Reinforces that organizations can adopt components incrementally
- **Missing Visual Opportunity:** Could benefit from framework architecture diagram showing how components interconnect
- **CTA Strength:** Strong guidance toward Guidelines page for detailed next steps
