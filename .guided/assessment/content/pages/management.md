## Notes

- **Parallel Track:** Management is separate career path, not "next step" after IC
- **Equal Seniority Potential:** Both IC and Manager tracks can reach executive level in mature frameworks
- **Different Skills:** Management requires people/leadership skills vs. IC's technical/domain skills
- **Time Allocation Shift:** Managers spend time on 1-on-1s, planning, meetings (not individual contribution)
- **Three Levels are Common:** Most organizations have 3-4 management levels (First-Line, Middle, Senior, sometimes C-Level)
- **Scope Doubles:** Each level roughly doubles scope (team → teams → department → organization)
- **Transition Timing:** IC → Manager often around Senior IC (Level 5-6); First-Line → Middle after 2-4 years
- **Reversibility:** W-Model supports Manager → IC transitions (management trial)
- **T-Shaped Requirement:** Managers need breadth (understand multiple domains) more than extreme depth
