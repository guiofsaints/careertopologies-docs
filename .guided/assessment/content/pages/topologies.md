## Content Blocks Outline

### 1. Introduction Section
- **Heading:** "Career Topologies"
- **Content:**
  - What are career topologies?
  - Why topology matters (defines career paths and transitions)
  - Topology as foundation for leveling and progression
  - One topology or hybrid approaches?

### 2. Y-Model Section
- **Heading:** "Y-Model Topology"
- **Visual:** Y-Model Diagram (fork in career path)
- **Description:**
  - Single track early in career
  - Fork at mid-level: Individual Contributor OR Manager
  - Two parallel tracks after fork
  - Limited bidirectional movement
- **Best For:**
  - Traditional organizations
  - Clear separation of IC and Manager roles
  - Stable organizational structures
- **Pros:**
  - Simple and clear
  - Established in many companies
  - Easy to communicate
- **Cons:**
  - Inflexible once fork is made
  - Can create pressure to manage for advancement
  - May limit IC growth perception

### 3. W-Model Section
- **Heading:** "W-Model Topology"
- **Visual:** W-Model Diagram (three tracks with bidirectional transitions)
- **Description:**
  - Three tracks: Individual Contributor, Manager, Technical Lead
  - Bidirectional transitions allowed
  - Technical Lead: deep technical expertise + leadership (no direct reports)
  - Multiple "forks" and "merges" possible
- **Best For:**
  - Growing technology organizations
  - Organizations valuing both technical depth and leadership
  - Cultures supporting role experimentation
- **Pros:**
  - Flexible career paths
  - Honors technical leadership without management
  - Supports IC→Manager→IC transitions (trial management)
- **Cons:**
  - More complex to explain
  - Requires organizational maturity
  - Technical Lead role needs clear definition

### 4. Network Model Section
- **Heading:** "Network Model Topology"
- **Visual:** Network Model Diagram (fluid, interconnected nodes)
- **Description:**
  - No fixed tracks
  - Career paths defined by projects, skills, and organizational needs
  - Fluid transitions based on contribution and growth
  - Roles may blend IC, leadership, and management aspects
- **Best For:**
  - Innovative, flat organizations (startups, agencies)
  - Project-based work
  - Cultures embracing ambiguity and autonomy
- **Pros:**
  - Maximum flexibility
  - Adapts to changing organizational needs
  - Empowers individuals to shape their paths
- **Cons:**
  - Can be unclear/confusing
  - Requires high trust and communication
  - Difficult to implement consistently at scale
  - May create perceived inequity

### 5. Comparative Table Section
- **Heading:** "Comparing Topology Models"
- **Component:** Table comparing Y, W, and Network models
- **Comparison Aspects:**
  | Aspect | Y-Model | W-Model | Network Model |
  |--------|---------|---------|---------------|
  | **Number of Tracks** | 2 (IC, Manager) | 3+ (IC, Manager, Tech Lead) | Fluid (project-based) |
  | **Flexibility** | Low (one-time fork) | Medium (bidirectional transitions) | High (continuous adaptation) |
  | **Best For** | Traditional orgs | Growing tech companies | Innovative startups |
  | **Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
  | **Clarity** | High | Medium | Low |
  | **Scalability** | High | Medium | Low |
  | **Career Transitions** | Limited (one-time) | Supported (IC↔Manager) | Continuous |
  | **Examples** | Many large corps | Google, Microsoft | Smaller tech companies |

### 6. Choosing Your Topology Section
- **Heading:** "Which Topology Should You Choose?"
- **Decision Framework:**
  - **Organization Size:** Smaller = more flexibility possible; Larger = need clarity
  - **Growth Stage:** Early stage = Network; Scaling = W; Mature = Y or W
  - **Culture:** Traditional = Y; Innovative = W or Network; Experimental = Network
  - **Industry:** Enterprise software = Y or W; Consulting/Agency = Network
  - **Existing Structure:** Evolution vs. revolution approach
- **Recommendation:** Start with Y or W; Network requires high organizational maturity

### 7. Hybrid Approaches Section
- **Heading:** "Hybrid and Custom Topologies"
- **Content:**
  - Organizations don't need to choose just one
  - Example: Y-Model for most roles, Network Model for specialized teams
  - Example: W-Model with temporary project-based rotations
  - Caution: Too much complexity can reduce clarity

- **Elements:**
  - Single path (Entry → Junior → Mid)
  - Fork at mid-level
  - Two parallel paths (IC track → Senior IC → Staff IC, Manager track → Manager → Senior Manager)
- **Purpose:** Visualize the one-time career fork decision

### 2. W-Model Diagram
- **Type:** Static diagram showing three tracks with transitions
- **Elements:**
  - Three parallel paths (IC, Manager, Tech Lead)
  - Bidirectional arrows showing transitions
  - Shared early levels
- **Purpose:** Show flexibility and role experimentation

### 3. Network Model Diagram
- **Type:** Static diagram showing fluid career paths
- **Elements:**
  - Web/network of interconnected roles
  - No fixed paths
  - Multiple nodes representing projects/skills
- **Purpose:** Illustrate fluid, project-based career paths

### 4. Comparative Topology Table
- **Type:** Static table with 3 columns (Y, W, Network) and ~8 rows (comparison aspects)
- **Purpose:** Side-by-side comparison for decision-making
- **Design:** Clear visual differentiation between models (possibly color-coded)

---

## Mobile Considerations

- Diagrams should be responsive and viewable on small screens
- Comparative table may require horizontal scroll or stacked mobile view
- Pros/cons lists for each model should be easily scannable

---

## Page Role in Site Architecture

**Position:** Foundational concept page  
**Function:** Explains structural foundation for entire framework  
**User Type:** Decision-makers choosing topology, ICs understanding career paths  
**Relation to Other Pages:**  
- Sibling to Concepts, Manifesto (foundational docs)
- Parent/prerequisite to Leveling (levels exist within topologies)
- Referenced from Framework, About, Management pages

---

## Notes

- **First Framework Decision:** Topology choice affects all subsequent framework design
- **Cultural Fit Critical:** Wrong topology creates friction (e.g., Network Model in bureaucratic org)
- **Visuals Essential:** Diagrams make abstract topology concepts concrete
- **Real-World Examples:** Comparative table references known companies (Google, Microsoft) for credibility
- **Flexibility Spectrum:** Y (rigid) → W (flexible) → Network (fluid)
- **Scalability Tradeoff:** More flexibility = harder to scale consistently
- **Not One-Size-Fits-All:** Different topologies suit different org stages and cultures
- **Evolution Possible:** Organizations can transition between topologies as they mature (e.g., Network → W → Y as they scale)
