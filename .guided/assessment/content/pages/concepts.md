  - **Impact & Autonomy** position levels along two key dimensions (level criteria)
  - **Shapes** describe skill distribution patterns (competency profiles)
- **Visual (if present):** Conceptual diagram showing relationships

### 4. Using Concepts in Practice Section
- **Heading:** "Applying These Concepts"
- **Use Cases:**

## Forms and Interactive Elements

**None** - Concepts page is definitional with cross-links. No data input or interactive tools.

---

## Visual Components

**None detected** - Concepts page is text-focused with clear definitions and cross-links. Visual diagrams for these concepts are on their respective detailed pages (Leveling, Progression, Topologies).

**Opportunity:** Could benefit from a conceptual relationship diagram showing how the seven concepts interconnect.
