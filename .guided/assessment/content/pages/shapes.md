# Skill Profiles (Shapes) Page Documentation

## Page Identity

**Route:** `/shapes`  
**Page Title:** Skill Profiles (Shapes)  
**Component:** ShapesPage.tsx  
**Category:** Docs (Specialized)  
**Primary Purpose:** Explain professional skill profiles (I-shaped, T-shaped, Pi-shaped) and how they complement career topologies and levels

---

## Page Purpose Statement

The Shapes page introduces skill profile concepts that add nuance to career development, providing:
1. Definitions of I, T, and Pi-shaped professional profiles
2. How breadth vs. depth of expertise affects career paths
3. Relationship between shapes and career levels/topologies
4. Guidance on developing from I → T → Pi over time

This page helps individuals and organizations understand that career growth isn't just vertical (levels) but also horizontal (skill breadth).

## Content Blocks Outline

### 1. Introduction Section
- **Heading:** "Professional Shapes: Breadth vs. Depth"
- **Content:**
  - What are professional shapes?
  - Why shapes matter (complement levels and topologies)
  - Shapes describe skill distribution, not seniority
  - Evolution: I → T → Pi over career

### 2. I-Shaped Profile Section
- **Heading:** "I-Shaped: Deep Specialist"
- **Visual:** I diagram showing single vertical line (depth in one domain)
- **Description:**
  - Deep expertise in single domain or technology
  - Narrow but profound knowledge
  - Typical early in career or in highly specialized roles
- **Strengths:**
  - Mastery of specific domain
  - Go-to expert for complex problems in specialty
  - Deep technical credibility
- **Challenges:**
  - Limited versatility
  - Difficulty collaborating across domains
  - Career mobility may be constrained
- **Examples:**
  - Database specialist focusing only on PostgreSQL
  - Security researcher in specific vulnerability class
  - Algorithm expert in specific optimization domain
- **When It Works:**
  - Highly specialized roles (research, deep technical work)
  - Organizations with clear domain boundaries
  - Early career while building foundational expertise

### 3. T-Shaped Profile Section
- **Heading:** "T-Shaped: Deep + Broad"
- **Visual:** T diagram showing vertical depth + horizontal breadth
- **Description:**
  - Deep expertise in one domain (vertical)
  - Broad working knowledge across related domains (horizontal)
  - Most common target for senior ICs
- **Strengths:**
  - Can lead projects requiring cross-functional understanding
  - Effective collaborator across teams
  - Translates between specialists
  - Versatile and adaptable
- **Challenges:**
  - Requires time to build breadth after depth
  - Risk of "jack of all trades, master of one"
  - Breadth must be maintained (skills decay)
- **Examples:**
  - Backend engineer (deep) with frontend, infrastructure, and product knowledge (broad)
  - Data scientist (deep) with engineering, business, and visualization skills (broad)
  - Product manager (deep) with design, engineering, and marketing fluency (broad)
- **When It Works:**
  - Senior IC roles requiring cross-functional leadership
  - Tech Lead positions
  - Organizations valuing collaboration and versatility

### 4. Pi-Shaped Profile Section
- **Heading:** "Pi-Shaped: Two Deep Domains"
- **Visual:** π (Pi) diagram showing two vertical lines + horizontal breadth
- **Description:**
  - Deep expertise in TWO distinct domains (two verticals)
  - Broad knowledge across others (horizontal)
  - Rare and valuable for bridging specialties
- **Strengths:**
  - Bridges between traditionally separate domains
  - Creates innovative solutions from cross-domain insights
  - Highly versatile and valuable
  - Can lead complex, multidisciplinary initiatives
- **Challenges:**
  - Takes years to develop (two deep expertises + breadth)
  - Risk of splitting focus and not achieving true depth in either
  - Requires intentional career planning
- **Examples:**
  - Engineer + Product Manager (technical depth + product depth)
  - Data Scientist + Software Engineer (ML depth + engineering depth)
  - Designer + Engineer (design depth + technical depth)
  - Security Expert + Infrastructure Expert
- **When It Works:**
  - Staff+ IC roles
  - Technical Lead or Principal Engineer positions
  - Startups or innovative environments requiring versatility
  - Bridging traditional organizational silos

### 5. Shapes and Career Levels Section
- **Heading:** "How Shapes Map to Career Levels"
- **Content:**
  - **Junior ICs (Levels 1-2):** Typically I-shaped (building first depth)
  - **Mid ICs (Levels 3-4):** Transitioning I → T (adding breadth)
  - **Senior ICs (Levels 5-6):** Solid T-shaped (deep + broad)
  - **Staff+ ICs (Levels 7-8):** Pi-shaped increasingly valuable (two depths + broad)
  - **Manager Track:** T or Pi-shaped almost required (must understand multiple domains)
  - **Tech Lead Track (W-Model):** Pi-shaped ideal (technical depth + leadership depth)

### 6. Shapes and Topologies Section
- **Heading:** "Shapes Across Topologies"
- **Content:**
  - **Y-Model:**
    - IC track: I → T progression
    - Manager track: T-shaped necessary (understand direct reports' domains)
  - **W-Model:**
    - IC track: I → T progression
    - Manager track: T-shaped necessary
    - Tech Lead track: Pi-shaped ideal (technical + leadership)
  - **Network Model:**
    - All shapes supported
    - Pi-shaped particularly valuable for fluid role transitions

### 7. Developing Your Shape Section
- **Heading:** "Growing from I to T to Pi"
- **Progression Path:**
  1. **Build Depth First (I-Shaped):** Become expert in core domain (1-3 years)
  2. **Add Breadth (I → T):** Learn adjacent domains through collaboration (2-4 years)
  3. **Maintain Depth + Breadth (T-Shaped):** Practice both to avoid skill decay (ongoing)
  4. **Add Second Depth (T → Pi):** Intentionally build expertise in second domain (3-5 years)
- **Strategies:**
  - **For Breadth:** Cross-functional projects, job rotations, mentorship from other domains
  - **For Second Depth:** Formal training, side projects, career pivot, hybrid roles
- **Timeline:** I → T takes 5-7 years; T → Pi takes additional 5-10 years (total 10-15+ year career)

### 8. Choosing Your Shape Section
- **Heading:** "Which Shape is Right for You?"
- **Content:**
  - **Choose I-Shaped if:**
    - You love going infinitely deep in one area
    - Highly specialized roles appeal to you
    - You're early career building foundational expertise
  - **Choose T-Shaped if:**
    - You want senior IC or manager roles
    - Collaboration and leadership appeal to you
    - Versatility is valuable in your organization
  - **Choose Pi-Shaped if:**
    - You're energized by bridging domains
    - You have patience for long-term skill building
    - Staff+ or Technical Lead roles are your goal
  - **Note:** Shape is descriptive, not prescriptive; all shapes are valuable

## Notes

- **Horizontal Growth Emphasis:** Shapes highlight that growth isn't just promotions (vertical) but also skill expansion (horizontal)
- **T-Shaped Popularity:** Most organizations target T-shaped for senior roles (balanced depth + breadth)
- **Pi-Shaped Rarity:** Pi-shaped is aspirational for Staff+ roles but takes 10-15+ years to develop genuinely
- **No Right Shape:** All shapes are valuable; choice depends on role, organization, and personal preference
- **Development Mindset:** Shapes evolve over career (not fixed at start)
- **Org Culture Dependence:** Some orgs value depth (I-shaped), others breadth (T-shaped), others bridges (Pi-shaped)
- **Cross-Functional Enabler:** T and Pi-shaped profiles enable better collaboration and innovation
- **Manager Requirement:** T-shaped minimum for managers (must understand multiple domains to lead effectively)
