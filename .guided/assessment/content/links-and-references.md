## Notes

1. **Repository URL Inconsistency**: The `constants.ts` file contains a placeholder repository URL `https://github.com/your-org/careertopologies` while the actual repository used throughout the Footer and Contributing page is `https://github.com/careertopologies/careertopologies`.

2. **Reference Links Languages**: Some reference links are in Portuguese (Brazil), particularly news articles about gender pay gap and workplace discrimination cases.

3. **Social Media Strategy**: The project maintains a presence across Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and GitHub, all linked from the footer for consistent community engagement.

4. **GitHub Integration**: Heavy integration with GitHub for community contributions, including direct links to issues, discussions, releases, and good first issues filtered by label.

5. **Academic Foundation**: Strong emphasis on academic and professional references with 28 external reference links organized by topic.

6. **Benchmarking Tools**: Includes links to popular career benchmarking platforms (levels.fyi, progression.fyi) to help users contextualize the framework.
