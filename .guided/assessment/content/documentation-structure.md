# Proposed Documentation Structure

## Overview

This document proposes a comprehensive documentation structure for the Career Topologies project, **focused on product purpose and user-facing content** rather than technical implementation. The structure is designed to serve the four primary audiences: Technology Leaders, HR/People Teams, Engineering Managers, and Individual Contributors.

---

## Documentation Philosophy

**Content-First Approach:**
- Focus on **what the framework is and how to use it**, not how it's coded
- Organize by **user needs and journeys**, not technical architecture
- Prioritize **actionable guidance** over theoretical concepts
- Provide **multiple entry points** for different audiences and use cases

**Audience-Centric Structure:**
- Technology Leaders → Strategic value, ROI, adoption case studies
- HR/People Teams → Implementation guides, governance, policy integration
- Engineering Managers → Practical tools for career conversations and assessments
- Individual Contributors → Career path clarity, growth opportunities, self-assessment

---

---

## Navigation Recommendations

### Primary Navigation (Top Menu)
```
Home | Framework | Use Cases | Implementation | Tools | Community | References
```

**Rationale:** 
- "Framework" replaces "About" as more action-oriented
- "Use Cases" highlights role-based guidance
- "Implementation" consolidates practical adoption steps
- "Tools" aggregates interactive elements
- "Community" emphasizes open-source nature

### Footer Navigation (Current Structure is Good)
```
Framework:               Resources:              Community:
- Leveling               - References            - Contributing
- Progression Pillars    - Concepts              - GitHub
- Guidelines             - Manifesto             - Discussions
- Topologies             - Shapes                - Issues
                         - Management
```

**Recommendation:** Keep current footer structure; it's comprehensive and well-organized

### Breadcrumb Navigation (Enhanced)
Add breadcrumbs showing:
```
Home > [Section] > [Page]
```
Example: `Home > Framework > Progression Pillars`

**Current Status:** Breadcrumbs exist; no changes needed

---

## Content Prioritization

### Must-Have (Current State)
✅ All framework components documented  
✅ Implementation guidance provided  
✅ Interactive tools available  
✅ References for credibility  
✅ Clear contribution pathways  

### Should-Have (Short-term enhancements)
🟡 Explicit "Getting Started" guide for each audience  
🟡 FAQ page consolidating common questions  
🟡 Troubleshooting section for implementation pitfalls  
🟡 Visual library aggregating diagrams/charts  

### Nice-to-Have (Long-term enhancements)
⚪ Case studies from adopting organizations  
⚪ Customization guide with adaptation examples  
⚪ Video tutorials and screencasts  
⚪ Downloadable worksheets and templates  
⚪ Roadmap and changelog for framework evolution  

---

## Documentation Governance

### Content Maintenance
- **Owner:** Project maintainers (GitHub organization)
- **Update Cadence:** As framework evolves (version-based)
- **Review Process:** Community feedback via GitHub Issues/Discussions
- **Quality Standards:** Clear, concise, actionable, evidence-based

### Content Principles
1. **Clarity:** Avoid jargon; define terms on first use
2. **Actionability:** Provide concrete steps, not just concepts
3. **Evidence:** Cite research and industry practices
4. **Inclusivity:** Support multiple career paths and learning styles
5. **Visual Support:** Use diagrams, charts, and examples liberally
6. **Navigability:** Multiple pathways to same content for different users

---

## Comparison: Current vs. Proposed Structure

| Aspect | Current Structure | Proposed Structure | Assessment |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| **Organization** | Topic-based (pages for each concept) | Audience + journey-based | Proposed adds explicit use case guidance |
| **Entry Points** | Home with framework cards | Home + Getting Started with role pathways | Proposed reduces friction for new users |
| **Depth** | Comprehensive (14 pages) | Similar depth + explicit journeys | Proposed organizes existing content better |
| **Tools** | Embedded in concept pages | Aggregated in Tools section | Proposed improves discoverability |
| **Visuals** | Distributed across pages | Also in Visual Library | Proposed enables quick reference |
| **Gaps** | No FAQ, Getting Started, Case Studies | Addresses these gaps | Proposed fills identified needs |

**Recommendation:** Current structure is **strong foundation**; proposed enhancements would improve usability for specific audiences without requiring major restructuring.

---

## Implementation Roadmap (For Documentation)

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 weeks)
1. Add "Getting Started" guide on Home page
2. Create FAQ page from common GitHub questions
3. Add troubleshooting section to Guidelines page

### Phase 2: Audience Enhancements (1 month)
1. Create "Use Cases" section with 4 role-based pages
2. Add Visual Library page aggregating diagrams
3. Enhance navigation with use case pathways

### Phase 3: Community Growth (Ongoing)
1. Collect adoption stories and create case studies
2. Add customization guide with examples
3. Create video tutorials for key concepts
4. Develop downloadable worksheets

---

## Conclusion

The current Career Topologies documentation is **comprehensive and well-structured**, covering all framework components with visual tools and implementation guidance. The proposed structure builds on this foundation by:

1. **Adding explicit user journeys** for different audiences
2. **Consolidating practical tools** for easier discovery
3. **Filling gaps** (FAQ, Getting Started, Case Studies)
4. **Enhancing navigation** with audience-centric pathways

**Priority Recommendation:** Add "Getting Started" guide and FAQ as quick wins to improve user onboarding while maintaining the strong existing structure.

---

**Document Purpose:** Propose content-focused documentation organization aligned to user needs  
**Status:** Complete  
**Next Steps:** Review with project maintainers for implementation prioritization
