### 3. Cross-Referencing

Extensive links between related topics. No isolated content—everything connects to the broader framework.

### 4. Practical and Actionable

Every conceptual topic includes "how to apply" guidance. Every process includes templates or examples.

### 5. Versioned and Evolving

Documentation acknowledges it will evolve. Includes version history and contribution pathways.

### 6. Multi-Format

- **Narrative**: Explanatory text
- **Reference**: Tables, matrices, glossaries
- **Visual**: Diagrams, flowcharts, infographics
