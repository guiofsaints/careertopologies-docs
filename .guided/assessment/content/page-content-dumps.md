## Route: `/concepts` (Concepts Page)

### Page Hero

**Title:** Core Concepts

**Description:** Career Topologies is built upon a set of key concepts that bring structure, clarity, and adaptability to career development in technology organizations. These concepts create a common language to guide teams, leaders, and individuals.

### Concepts Section

#### 1. Career Topology

A topology defines the structure of career growth within an organization. It determines the possible paths a person can follow over time—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—based on their role, goals, and organizational context.

**Types of topologies:**

- Y-Model: Classic split between management and technical IC paths
- W-Model: Adds a hybrid project/technical leadership path
- Network Model: Enables fluid, non-linear transitions across domains

See /topologies for more →

#### 2. Leveling

Leveling is the definition of career levels within a discipline or area (e.g., Junior, Mid, Senior, Staff, Principal). Levels guide expectations for impact, responsibility, and scope.

**Leveling supports:**

- Transparent job architecture
- Compensation bands
- Promotion calibration
- Performance assessments

See /framework/leveling for more →

#### 3. Progression Pillars

Progression Pillars represent the competencies, skills, and behaviors expected at each level. They serve as a foundation for growth conversations, feedback, and development plans.

**Pillars may include:**

- Technical or domain expertise
- Communication and collaboration
- Strategic thinking or delivery impact
- Mentorship and influence

See /framework/progression for more →

#### 4. Shapes (Skill Profiles)

Shapes describe how individuals operate based on the depth and breadth of their skills. Understanding shapes helps with team composition, hiring, and personal development.

**Types of shapes:**

- I-Shaped: Deep expertise in one discipline
- T-Shaped: Depth in one area, awareness in others
- Pi-Shaped: Strong in two+ areas, with strategic range

See /shapes for more →

#### 5. Role of the Ladder

The ladder is a documented structure that combines topology, leveling, and progression pillars to guide a team or discipline's growth path. It is both a tool for individuals and a system for organizations.

**Each ladder includes:**

- A defined set of levels
- Skill expectations per level
- Promotion guidelines
- Governance and maintenance rules

#### 6. Governance and Roles

Career Topologies defines clear ownership and responsibilities to keep the system effective. Governance ensures consistency and trust across the organization.

**Key roles:**

- Track Owner: Facilitates definition, rollout, and review of a ladder
- Leadership & BPs: Apply guidelines, ensure fairness
- HR & Compensation: Align to company policy, compensation structures
- Employees: Own their career and participate actively

See /framework/guidelines for more →

#### 7. Evolution & Flexibility

Topologies and ladders must evolve. As teams grow, strategies shift, and new skills emerge, the career system should adapt accordingly.

**Best practices:**

- Revisit pillars and levels regularly
- Welcome input from contributors and leads
- Document updates transparently

### Foundation Section

These concepts form the foundation of the Career Topologies model. They ensure that career design is not just a document—but a living framework, responsive to real-world complexity.

## Route: `/manifesto` (Manifesto Page)

### Page Hero

**Title:** Career Manifesto

**Description:** The Career Topologies Manifesto defines the foundational principles for building fair, transparent, and sustainable career paths in technology organizations. It acknowledges the dual responsibility between individuals and organizations: while professionals are accountable for their growth, companies must provide clear expectations and equal opportunities.

### The 8 Principles

#### 1. Transparency

Growth opportunities must be openly accessible to everyone, with clearly defined expectations for each role and level.

#### 2. Fair Recognition

Promotions and recognition should be based on tangible contributions, not favoritism. Everyone must have access to the tools and environment needed to succeed.

#### 3. Equality

There must be equal conditions regarding compensation, benefits, and treatment for all people in the same position—regardless of background or identity.

#### 4. Consistency

Career progression should value consistent, long-term contributions, rather than isolated achievements.

#### 5. Cooperation

Career development is not a zero-sum game. Fostering collaboration over competition helps reduce anxiety and builds collective success.

#### 6. Diversity

Companies must actively promote inclusion and support underrepresented groups, especially in leadership and decision-making positions.

#### 7. Ownership

Career growth is a shared responsibility. While the company offers structure and support, each person should define their own path and drive their development.

#### 8. Flexibility

Organizations must support movement between roles, specialties, and disciplines, enabling both vertical and lateral transitions based on individual goals.

### Compass Section

These principles serve as a compass for organizations implementing the Career Topologies framework. They ensure that growth paths are aligned not only with business goals but also with fairness, personal agency, and long-term sustainability.

## Route: `/topologies` (Topologies Page)

### Page Hero

**Title:** Career Topologies

**Description:** In Career Topologies, the term 'topology' refers to the structural models used to organize career progression within an organization. These models define the possible directions a career can take based on individual choices, organizational strategy, and structure.

**Note:** There is no single ideal model—organizations may adopt one or multiple topologies depending on their size, maturity, or cultural needs.

### Topology Models

#### Y-Model: Split Path: Management or Technical

This is a classic bifurcation model where professionals grow in either a leadership or a technical individual contributor (IC) track.

**Tracks:**

- Leadership: People management, business ownership
- IC: Technical depth, architecture, mentoring, innovation

**Use Cases:** Best for organizations that want to clearly separate people management from technical growth

**Recommended For:** Mid-to-large organizations with stable hierarchies and traditional HR practices

**Key Strengths:**

- Simple to implement and communicate
- Empowers specialists to grow without switching to management

#### W-Model: Hybrid Leadership and Technical Paths

The W-Model builds upon the Y-Model by adding a third path that blends project ownership with technical depth.

**Tracks:**

- Leadership: People and strategy
- IC: Deep technical expertise
- Project/Tech Management: Hybrid delivery, technical influence, and coordination

**Use Cases:** Ideal for tech leads, program managers, or staff engineers who lead without formal people management

**Recommended For:** Consulting firms, product companies with matrix structures, and growing tech orgs

**Key Strengths:**

- Encourages hybrid skill sets
- Offers a more flexible growth path

#### Network Model: Fluid and Lateral Growth

The Network Model allows professionals to move laterally across roles, functions, or domains based on interest, opportunity, and performance.

**Tracks:**

- Not predefined; driven by individual agency and organizational flexibility

**Use Cases:** Great for startups, creative industries, or evolving organizations with flatter hierarchies

**Recommended For:** Early-stage startups, innovation labs, learning organizations

**Key Strengths:**

- Promotes exploration and adaptability
- Supports multidisciplinary growth

## Route: `/framework/progression` (Progression Pillars Page)

### Page Hero

**Title:** Career Topologies – Progression Pillars

**Description:** The Progression Pillars are the heart of growth evaluation within the Career Topologies framework. They answer the question: 'What defines a person's evolution within their career track?'

### Pillar Objectives

#### Objective Criteria

Make growth criteria objective and measurable

#### Consistent Feedback

Help leaders give consistent and actionable feedback

#### Self-Development

Empower team members in their self-development journey

#### Development Plans

Support the design of individual development plans (IDPs)

### Pillar Structure

Each career track (e.g., Engineering, Product, Design) can define its own pillars, but all should be anchored in a common structure that considers:

1. **Delivery & Execution**  
   Ability to deliver value with quality, consistency and efficiency

2. **Technical Domain / Specialization**  
   Depth in the core knowledge of the function

3. **Collaboration & Influence**  
   Team contribution, effective communication, influence without authority

4. **Autonomy & Decision Making**  
   Ability to act with increasing independence

5. **Initiative & Innovation**  
   Proposes solutions, improvements, experiments and learns

6. **Mentoring & Multiplication**  
   Develops other people, shares knowledge, contributes to culture

These pillars can be combined in a "shape" model (e.g., T-shaped: broad execution + deep specialization).

### Software Engineering Example

| Pillar                     | Senior Level Example                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Delivery & Execution       | Leads critical and iterative deliveries with quality and measurable impact    |
| Technical Domain           | Reference in architecture and best practices in the used stack                |
| Collaboration & Influence  | Acts as bridge between teams, participates in RFCs and cross-team discussions |
| Autonomy & Decision        | Solves complex problems independently with proper justification               |
| Initiative & Innovation    | Introduces new solutions that generate efficiency or product gains            |
| Mentoring & Multiplication | Acts as formal and informal mentor, leads knowledge sharing rituals           |

### Interactive Visualizations

**Disclaimer:** These are visual examples of how to provide visibility into progression and expectations. Each company should develop their own leveling system tailored to their specific organizational context, culture, and business needs.

[Detailed examples for Junior, Mid-level, Senior, and Staff levels across all six pillars]

### Applicability

- **Continuous Feedback:** Each pillar serves as a basis for qualitative feedback
- **Promotions & Leveling:** Progression in each pillar indicates readiness for the next level
- **IDPs:** Pillar with less maturation can be the focus of development
- **Comparability:** Different teams with common evaluation standards

## Route: `/framework/guidelines` (Guidelines Page)

### Page Hero

**Title:** Guidelines

**Description:** Comprehensive guide to operationalizing the Career Topologies framework inside an organization. It translates the philosophy of leveling, progression, principles, and topology into practical workflows, responsibilities, and communication strategies.

### Framework Implementation Flow

[Diagram showing: Topology → Ladder → Levels → Pillars]

### How to Use the Framework

#### Ownership and Roles

- **HR:** Responsible for overall governance, coordination of review cycles, and integration into compensation.
- **Team Leads / Managers:** Responsible for applying the framework in feedback, 1:1s, leveling discussions, and performance assessments.
- **Employees:** Empowered to understand the framework and use it to guide their career path.

#### Integration Points

- **Onboarding:** Include overview in onboarding materials.
- **Feedback cycles:** Use progression pillars as reference.
- **Calibration:** Align team leads on evaluation criteria and maturity expectations.

### Roles and Responsibilities Matrix

### Communication Best Practices

- Be explicit about expectations: Share ladder levels, pillars, and criteria in internal documentation.
- Frame feedback using the structure: Instead of vague phrases like "be more senior", say "develop more autonomy in cross-team initiatives as expected for level 3."
- Discuss progression in 1:1s: Create individual development plans linked to progression pillars.
- During calibration: Anchor discussions in the ladder and avoid subjective comparisons.

### Promotion Process Guide

#### Promotion Proposal Flow

1. Manager drafts promotion justification aligned to the ladder.
2. Peer or partner reviewer validates consistency.
3. Calibration group reviews cases together.
4. HR validates consistency across teams.
5. Final approval by leadership (VP/Director).

#### Requirements

- Demonstration of sustained performance at the next level.
- Maturity across most progression pillars.
- Peer feedback, delivery records, and mentorship evidence.

#### Timeline

- Biannual or quarterly promotion windows.
- Defined deadlines for proposal submission, review, and outcome communication.

### Compensation and Titles (Optional but Recommended)

- Each level can be mapped to a compensation band, either visible or internal.
- Distinguish between internal levels and external-facing titles.
- Ensure fairness and internal equity in how titles and compensation are assigned.

### Governance and Updates

- Annual review cycle for updating the framework.
- Collect feedback from ICs, managers, and HR.
- Track version changes and improvement history.
- Create an advisory group (HR + ICs + managers) to own the evolution.

### Implementation Roadmap

#### 8-Step Implementation Plan

[Timeline showing 8 phases over 24 weeks]

1. **Kickoff & Alignment** – define purpose and success metrics.
2. **Select Topology** – Y, W, or Network model.
3. **Define Leveling & Pillars** – adapt per discipline.
4. **Align Ladder Principles** – validate with leadership.
5. **Pilot in Small Teams** – test communication and feedback.
6. **Organization-wide Rollout** – include in onboarding and reviews.
7. **Embed in People Ops** – integrate into performance and compensation.
8. **Maintain & Evolve** – establish review cycle and governance.
