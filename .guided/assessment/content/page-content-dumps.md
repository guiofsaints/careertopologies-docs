### Core Components

## Core Components

The structure of Career Topologies is built upon four pillars:

1. **Leveling**
   Defines job titles and seniority levels across areas

2. **Progression Pillars**
   Guides knowledge, skills, and behavior expectations

3. **Ladder Principles**
   Establishes rules for fair promotions and movement

4. **Guidelines**
   Offers best practices for applying and maintaining the model

---

### Governance & Roles

## Governance & Roles

The framework also outlines the roles and responsibilities of people involved in career development—from ICs and managers to HR, business partners, and compensation teams. Everyone has a part in ensuring the model is applied fairly and evolves with the organization.

---

### Management Model

## Management Model

Career Topologies recognizes that management operates at different layers:

1. **Front-line Managers**
   Handle daily execution and team support

2. **Middle Managers**
   Translate strategy into structure and planning

3. **Top Managers**
   Set long-term vision and business direction

Each layer has its own focus, impact, and recommended competencies.

---

### Professional Shapes

## Professional Shapes

Not all professionals grow in the same way. The framework includes three key skill profiles:

**I-Shaped**
Deep specialists

**T-Shaped**
Specialists with broad collaboration capability

**π (Pi-Shaped / Comp-Shaped)**
Multidisciplinary experts with high autonomy

These profiles help teams design the right mix of talent and support individual aspirations.

## /topologies (Topologies Page)

**Page Title**
# Career Topologies

**Page Description**
In Career Topologies, the term 'topology' refers to the structural models used to organize career progression within an organization. These models define the possible directions a career can take based on individual choices, organizational strategy, and structure.

**Note**
There is no single ideal model—organizations may adopt one or multiple topologies depending on their size, maturity, or cultural needs.

---

### Topology Models

## Topology Models

#### Y-Model
**Subtitle**: Split Path: Management or Technical

This is a classic bifurcation model where professionals grow in either a leadership or a technical individual contributor (IC) track.

**Tracks:**
- Leadership: People management, business ownership
- IC: Technical depth, architecture, mentoring, innovation

**Use Cases:**
Best for organizations that want to clearly separate people management from technical growth

**Recommended For:**
Mid-to-large organizations with stable hierarchies and traditional HR practices

**Key Strengths:**
- Simple to implement and communicate
- Empowers specialists to grow without switching to management

**Visual**: Diagram showing Y-Model career progression from Intern → Junior → Mid → Senior → (bifurcation) → Staff/Principal/Distinguished/Fellow OR Manager I/II/Sr Manager/Director/VP → C-Level

---

#### W-Model
**Subtitle**: Hybrid Leadership and Technical Paths

The W-Model builds upon the Y-Model by adding a third path that blends project ownership with technical depth.

**Tracks:**
- Leadership: People and strategy
- IC: Deep technical expertise
- Project/Tech Management: Hybrid delivery, technical influence, and coordination

**Use Cases:**
Ideal for tech leads, program managers, or staff engineers who lead without formal people management

**Recommended For:**
Consulting firms, product companies with matrix structures, and growing tech orgs

**Key Strengths:**
- Encourages hybrid skill sets
- Offers a more flexible growth path

**Visual**: Diagram showing W-Model with three distinct paths converging at C-Level

#### Network Model
**Subtitle**: Fluid and Lateral Growth

The Network Model allows professionals to move laterally across roles, functions, or domains based on interest, opportunity, and performance.

**Tracks:**
- Not predefined; driven by individual agency and organizational flexibility

**Use Cases:**
Great for startups, creative industries, or evolving organizations with flatter hierarchies

**Recommended For:**
Early-stage startups, innovation labs, learning organizations

**Key Strengths:**
- Promotes exploration and adaptability
- Supports multidisciplinary growth

**Visual**: Diagram showing Network Model with fluid lateral movement and interconnected role transitions

**Page Title**
# Core Concepts

**Page Description**
Career Topologies is built upon a set of key concepts that bring structure, clarity, and adaptability to career development in technology organizations. These concepts create a common language to guide teams, leaders, and individuals.

---

### Concepts

#### Concept 1: Career Topology

A topology defines the structure of career growth within an organization. It determines the possible paths a person can follow over time—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally—based on their role, goals, and organizational context.

**Types of topologies:**
- Y-Model: Classic split between management and technical IC paths
- W-Model: Adds a hybrid project/technical leadership path
- Network Model: Enables fluid, non-linear transitions across domains

See /topologies for more →

---

#### Concept 2: Leveling

Leveling is the definition of career levels within a discipline or area (e.g., Junior, Mid, Senior, Staff, Principal). Levels guide expectations for impact, responsibility, and scope.

**Leveling supports:**
- Transparent job architecture
- Compensation bands
- Promotion calibration
- Performance assessments

See /framework/leveling for more →

---

#### Concept 3: Progression Pillars

Progression Pillars represent the competencies, skills, and behaviors expected at each level. They serve as a foundation for growth conversations, feedback, and development plans.

**Pillars may include:**
- Technical or domain expertise
- Communication and collaboration
- Strategic thinking or delivery impact
- Mentorship and influence

See /framework/progression for more →

---

#### Concept 4: Shapes (Skill Profiles)

Shapes describe how individuals operate based on the depth and breadth of their skills. Understanding shapes helps with team composition, hiring, and personal development.

**Types of shapes:**
- I-Shaped: Deep expertise in one discipline
- T-Shaped: Depth in one area, awareness in others
- Pi-Shaped: Strong in two+ areas, with strategic range

See /shapes for more →

---

#### Concept 5: Role of the Ladder

The ladder is a documented structure that combines topology, leveling, and progression pillars to guide a team or discipline's growth path. It is both a tool for individuals and a system for organizations.

**Each ladder includes:**
- A defined set of levels
- Skill expectations per level
- Promotion guidelines
- Governance and maintenance rules

---

#### Concept 6: Governance and Roles

Career Topologies defines clear ownership and responsibilities to keep the system effective. Governance ensures consistency and trust across the organization.

**Key roles:**
- Track Owner: Facilitates definition, rollout, and review of a ladder
- Leadership & BPs: Apply guidelines, ensure fairness
- HR & Compensation: Align to company policy, compensation structures
- Employees: Own their career and participate actively

See /framework/guidelines for more →

---

#### Concept 7: Evolution & Flexibility

Topologies and ladders must evolve. As teams grow, strategies shift, and new skills emerge, the career system should adapt accordingly.

**Best practices:**
- Revisit pillars and levels regularly
- Welcome input from contributors and leads
- Document updates transparently

---

### Foundation

## Foundation

These concepts form the foundation of the Career Topologies model. They ensure that career design is not just a document—but a living framework, responsive to real-world complexity.

---

## /manifesto (Manifesto Page)

**Page Title**
# Career Manifesto

**Page Description**
The Career Topologies Manifesto defines the foundational principles for building fair, transparent, and sustainable career paths in technology organizations. It acknowledges the dual responsibility between individuals and organizations: while professionals are accountable for their growth, companies must provide clear expectations and equal opportunities.

---

### The 8 Principles

## The 8 Principles

#### Principle 1: Transparency

Growth opportunities must be openly accessible to everyone, with clearly defined expectations for each role and level.

---

#### Principle 2: Fair Recognition

Promotions and recognition should be based on tangible contributions, not favoritism. Everyone must have access to the tools and environment needed to succeed.

---

#### Principle 3: Equality

There must be equal conditions regarding compensation, benefits, and treatment for all people in the same position—regardless of background or identity.

---

#### Principle 4: Consistency

Career progression should value consistent, long-term contributions, rather than isolated achievements.

---

#### Principle 5: Cooperation

Career development is not a zero-sum game. Fostering collaboration over competition helps reduce anxiety and builds collective success.

---

#### Principle 6: Diversity

Companies must actively promote inclusion and support underrepresented groups, especially in leadership and decision-making positions.

---

#### Principle 7: Ownership

Career growth is a shared responsibility. While the company offers structure and support, each person should define their own path and drive their development.

---

#### Principle 8: Flexibility

Organizations must support movement between roles, specialties, and disciplines, enabling both vertical and lateral transitions based on individual goals.

---

### Compass

These principles serve as a compass for organizations implementing the Career Topologies framework. They ensure that growth paths are aligned not only with business goals but also with fairness, personal agency, and long-term sustainability.

## Growth and Transitions

Professionals naturally evolve across shapes throughout their careers. Some may start as I-Shaped and grow into T- or Pi-Shaped profiles. Organizations should:

- **Offer clarity on expectations**: Provide clear expectations for each profile to help individuals understand requirements
- **Avoid imposing shapes**: Let individuals align based on their interests and organizational context
- **Encourage learning paths**: Support evolution across profiles with structured development opportunities

The framework will expand on shape transitions in future versions, including examples of development paths and mentorship strategies.

# Management Levels

**Page Description**
Career Topologies recognizes that management is not a one-size-fits-all role. Effective leadership requires different focus areas depending on whether you're managing day-to-day execution, translating strategy into plans, or setting the overall direction of the organization. This framework distinguishes three distinct layers of management—each with unique responsibilities, planning horizons, and skill sets.
