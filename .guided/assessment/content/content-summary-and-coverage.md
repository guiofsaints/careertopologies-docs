## Gaps and TODOs

### Minor Gaps Identified

1. **No Search Functionality:** Site relies on navigation and links; no search bar detected
2. **No User Accounts:** No login, registration, or personalization features (expected for documentation site)
3. **No Analytics Dashboard:** No visible metrics or progress tracking for users (framework is guidance, not SaaS)
4. **Limited Multimedia:** No videos, podcasts, or interactive tutorials (text and diagrams only)
5. **No Downloadable Templates:** Framework is presented online; no downloadable worksheets or templates mentioned

### None of These Are True Gaps
The above "gaps" are **expected characteristics** of a documentation website and do not represent missing functionality. Career Topologies is designed as:
- **Reference documentation** (not a SaaS application)
- **Open-source framework** (not a commercial product)
- **Community-driven resource** (GitHub-centric, not marketing-focused)

### Recommended Enhancements (Future State)

1. **Search Functionality:** Add site-wide search for easier content discovery
2. **Downloadable Resources:** Provide PDF guides, worksheets, or implementation checklists
3. **Case Studies:** Add real-world adoption stories from organizations
4. **Video Tutorials:** Create screencasts explaining key framework concepts
5. **Interactive Tools:** Build calculators for level assessment or competency gap analysis
6. **Multi-language Support:** Currently English-only; framework has language config but no translations
7. **Versioning:** Track framework versions and changes over time (currently v1.0.0)

**Priority:** Low – current implementation is comprehensive and fit for purpose

---

## Content Quality Assessment

### Strengths

✅ **Comprehensive Coverage:** 14 pages cover all aspects of career framework design and implementation  
✅ **Clear Structure:** Hub-and-spoke architecture with logical content hierarchy  
✅ **Visual Richness:** 10 interactive/static components make complex concepts accessible  
✅ **Evidence-Based:** 28 academic and professional citations provide credibility  
✅ **Actionable Guidance:** Implementation lifecycle, roles matrix, and timeline support practical adoption  
✅ **Multiple Entry Points:** Navigation accommodates different user journeys (explorers, implementers, skeptics)  
✅ **Open and Transparent:** Open-source philosophy aligned with framework values  
✅ **Consistent Tone:** Professional, educational, balanced throughout  

### Areas for Improvement (Content)

⚠️ **No Glossary Page:** Domain vocabulary defined contextually but no centralized glossary (entities doc addresses this)  
⚠️ **Limited "Getting Started":** No single "Quick Start" or "New to Career Frameworks?" guide  
⚠️ **No FAQ:** Common questions answered in content but no dedicated FAQ page  
⚠️ **No Blog/Updates:** Static documentation; no news, updates, or thought leadership content  

**Priority:** Low to Medium – current structure is effective; these are enhancements, not deficiencies
