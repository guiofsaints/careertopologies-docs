# Purpose and Audience

## Project Purpose

Career Topologies is an open-source strategic framework designed to address a critical challenge facing technology organizations: creating career development systems that are simultaneously clear, fair, inclusive, and aligned with business needs. The framework emerged from the recognition that traditional career ladders often fail to account for the multidimensional nature of professional growth in modern technology companies, where individuals may progress through technical mastery, leadership development, or hybrid paths that blend multiple competencies.

The project provides a structured yet adaptable foundation for organizations to design career paths that empower both technical individual contributors (ICs) and people managers. Unlike rigid hierarchical models, Career Topologies embraces the complexity of modern work by offering multiple "topology" patterns—including Y-shaped (dual-track), W-shaped (multi-track), and Network models (fluid progression)—each suited to different organizational contexts, growth stages, and cultural philosophies.

At its core, the framework addresses three fundamental needs:

1. **Organizational Clarity**: Providing a shared language and structure for discussing career progression, eliminating ambiguity about expectations, levels, and pathways.

2. **Individual Empowerment**: Giving professionals visibility into their growth options and concrete criteria for advancement, enabling self-directed career development.

3. **Systemic Fairness**: Establishing objective evaluation criteria, transparent processes, and governance mechanisms that reduce bias and promote equity in promotions, compensation, and recognition.

Career Topologies version 1.0 represents a comprehensive, opinionated starting point that organizations can adopt and adapt to their unique needs. The framework is deliberately positioned as living documentation—designed to evolve alongside organizational maturity, industry trends, and community contributions.

#### 3. Individual Contributors Planning Growth

**Profile**: Software engineers, product designers, data scientists, and other technical professionals seeking to understand their career options and chart their growth paths.

**Primary Needs:**
- Transparency about career level expectations and advancement criteria
- Visibility into alternative growth paths (IC vs management, hybrid roles)
- Self-assessment tools and development guidance
- Understanding of skill profiles (I-shaped, T-shaped, Pi-shaped) and how they evolve
- Clarity on what it takes to reach senior IC levels (Staff, Principal, Distinguished)
- Ability to own and drive their career development

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Opaque promotion processes and unclear expectations
- Pressure to move into management as the only advancement path
- Uncertainty about how to grow beyond "Senior" as an IC
- Lack of objective feedback tied to concrete criteria
- Fear of being "stuck" or having limited growth options

**How Career Topologies Helps:**
ICs gain access to detailed level descriptions, progression pillar definitions with concrete examples, and visual tools showing their current position and growth trajectories. The framework explicitly validates multiple career shapes and topologies, empowering professionals to choose paths aligned with their interests and strengths.

- Guidance on timing and phasing career framework implementation
- Models for governance, ownership, and continuous evolution
- Approaches that scale without excessive bureaucracy
- Integration with business strategy and organizational design
- Support for cultural fit and values alignment

**Pain Points Addressed:**
- Premature or over-engineered career frameworks that don't match organizational maturity

- Difficulty balancing structure with flexibility and agency
- Lack of clarity on roles and responsibilities for framework maintenance
- Frameworks that become outdated quickly as the organization evolves

**How Career Topologies Helps:**
Organizations receive comparative guidance on Y, W, and Network models with recommendations for different contexts, maturity stages, and cultural values. The implementation lifecycle provides a realistic 8-phase roadmap spanning 24 weeks, with specific activities for Design, Pilot, Rollout, and Maintenance phases.
