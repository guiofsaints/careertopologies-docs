# Career Topologies

Three structural models for organizing career paths in technology organizations.

## The Three Models

1. **Y-Model (Dual Track)**: IC and Manager tracks diverge at senior level
2. **W-Model (Tri-Track)**: Adds hybrid IC/Manager track for flexibility
3. **Network Model**: Fluid lateral movement across multiple dimensions

Each model has different strengths, trade-offs, and organizational fit.

_Detailed model comparisons and decision guidance will be added in Phase 3._
