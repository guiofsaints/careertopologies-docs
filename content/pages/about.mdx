# About Career Topologies

Career Topologies is an open-source strategic framework designed to transform how technology organizations approach career development.

## What This Framework Provides

The site delivers a comprehensive, modular framework that organizations can adopt and customize to their unique context. Unlike rigid corporate ladders or vague seniority titles, Career Topologies offers structured flexibility through:

- Multiple career topology models (Y-shaped, W-shaped, and Network)
- Clear leveling criteria based on Impact and Autonomy
- Six concrete Progression Pillars that translate abstract expectations into actionable competencies

## Why It Exists

Traditional career frameworks fail to address the multidimensional nature of professional growth in modern technology companies. Career Topologies addresses these failures by providing:

- Evidence-based structures grounded in 28 academic and professional references
- Visual tools that make concepts tangible
- Detailed implementation guidance spanning governance, processes, and timelines

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Explore** the foundational concepts to understand the philosophy
2. **Select** a topology model that fits your organization
3. **Customize** the leveling and progression frameworks
4. **Implement** using our detailed guidelines

_More detailed content will be added in Phase 3._
