# Core Concepts

Understanding these seven core concepts is essential for implementing the Career Topologies framework.

## 1. Topology

A career topology defines the structural shape of possible career paths within an organization.

## 2. Level

A career level represents a distinct stage of professional growth, defined by Impact and Autonomy.

## 3. Pillar

Progression pillars are the six competency dimensions used to evaluate growth and readiness for advancement.

## 4. Proficiency

Proficiency measures skill depth within a specific technical or functional domain.

## 5. Impact

Impact measures the scope and significance of an individual's contributions to organizational goals.

## 6. Autonomy

Autonomy measures the degree of independence in decision-making and problem-solving.

## 7. Shape

Professional shapes (I, T, Pi) describe an individual's skill profile breadth and depth.

_Detailed definitions and examples will be added in Phase 3._
