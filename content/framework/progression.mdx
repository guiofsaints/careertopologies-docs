# Progression Pillars

Six competency dimensions translate abstract level expectations into concrete, observable behaviors.

## The Six Pillars

1. **Delivery**: Ability to complete work and ship results
2. **Technical Domain**: Depth and breadth of technical expertise
3. **Collaboration**: Working effectively with others
4. **Autonomy**: Independence in problem-solving and decision-making
5. **Initiative**: Proactive identification and pursuit of opportunities
6. **Mentoring**: Supporting and developing others

## Proficiency Scales

Each pillar has a proficiency scale from 1-5, aligned with career levels.
