# Career Framework Overview

The Career Topologies framework consists of four core structural elements that work together to create transparent, equitable career paths.

## Four Core Elements

1. **Topologies**: The structural shape of career paths (Y, W, or Network models)
2. **Leveling**: Career levels defined by Impact × Autonomy dimensions
3. **Progression Pillars**: Six competency dimensions for evaluation
4. **Guidelines**: Implementation roadmap and governance structures

## Governance Model

Effective framework implementation requires clear ownership and decision-making processes.

## Implementation Lifecycle

The framework follows an 8-phase implementation process spanning 52+ weeks.

_Detailed content will be added in Phase 3._
