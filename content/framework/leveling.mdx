# Career Leveling

Career levels represent distinct stages of professional growth, defined primarily by Impact and Autonomy.

## Impact × Autonomy Matrix

The foundation of our leveling system is the two-dimensional Impact × Autonomy matrix.

### Six Career Levels

1. **Junior** (Level 1)
2. **Mid-Level** (Level 2)
3. **Senior** (Level 3)
4. **Staff** (Level 4)
5. **Principal** (Level 5)
6. **Distinguished** (Level 6)

## Topology Alignment

Different topology models may interpret these levels differently.

_Interactive matrix and detailed level definitions will be added in Phase 3._
